  },
  {
    speaker1: "Do you think there are more noises than before?",
    speaker2:
      "Probably, especially in cities nowadays because of urbanization. There are more people in cars and cities, and a lot of industries are also making loud noise, so many people feel they can't enjoy the peaceful environment they want.",
